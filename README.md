# Welcome to Proexe Android recruitment task

Your task is to implement some parts of the app according to supplied designs.

## Design
You can preview the  
design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/oyMtT5hacV2xnOjyW9eQFz/Zadanie-rekrutacyjne?node-id=0%3A1)

Log in to Figma using your account or create one (it is free) to inspect the design and be able to  
check precise design requirements (Inspect Mode).

Colors and icons are included in the Android Studio project. If something is missing, add it  
manually by extracting resources from the Figma project (Export in Inspect Mode).

## Task

There are 4 parts of this task described below. Try to do as much as you can. Feel free to add  
needed files, classes libraries, patterns that are required to provide quality etc. The source  
Code contains the bare minimum for the application. The rest is up to you. We highly encourage you
to use Jetpack Compose, but it is not a requirement, so feel free to implement UI using the
technology you  
prefer.

### 1. [List of programs](https://www.figma.com/file/oyMtT5hacV2xnOjyW9eQFz/Zadanie-rekrutacyjne?node-id=1%3A81)

You should implement the main view with the list. Try to make it as close to the design as
possible.  
Note: You are provided with two simple repositories. Use them as a data source.

### 2. [Drawer ](https://www.figma.com/file/oyMtT5hacV2xnOjyW9eQFz/Zadanie-rekrutacyjne?node-id=1%3A691)

Try to make a drawer as presented above.  
Note: You will find titles of the items in `values/strings.xml` file

### 3. [Dropdown menu](https://www.figma.com/file/oyMtT5hacV2xnOjyW9eQFz/Zadanie-rekrutacyjne?node-id=1%3A1212)

Create a dropdown menu with a list of categories. Note: there is no provider added for the list of
categories. Decide which is the best way to provide this list and implement it in the project  
yourself.

### 4. Polishing

Try to polish the whole thing, look again at everything you did, and try to clean up the source
code (if it is possible).

## Time

You have 24 hours to complete the task. Try to do as much as you can.

## Git

You should create additional git branches and commits as needed.

## Solution

When checking your solution, we will not only focus on its design, but also check how you solve
typical Android and software-engineering challenges (for example: code structure, app architecture,
correct usage of particular libraries and their APIs). The project will be some kind of a starting
point for our future technical interview.

## Sending your solution

Please send your solution as a .zip file with the git inside as attachment with the thread we  
started sending a task in the first place.
